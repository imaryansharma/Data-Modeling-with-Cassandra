Part I. ETL Pipeline for Pre-Processing the Files
PLEASE RUN THE FOLLOWING CODE FOR PRE-PROCESSING THE FILES

Creating list of filepaths to process original event csv data files

# checking your current working directory

print(os.getcwd())

# Get your current folder and subfolder event data

filepath = os.getcwd() + '/event_data'

# Create a for loop to create a list of files and collect each filepath

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(filepath):

    

# join the file path and roots with the subdirectories using glob

Part II. Complete the Apache Cassandra coding portion of your project.
Now you are ready to work with the CSV file titled event_datafile_new.csv, located within the Workspace directory. The event_datafile_new.csv contains the following columns:

    artist
    firstName of user
    gender of user
    item number in session
    last name of user
    length of the song
    level (paid or free song)
    location of the user
    sessionId
    song title
    userId

The image below is a screenshot of what the denormalized data should appear like in the event_datafile_new.csv after the code above is run:

Now we need to create tables to run the following queries. Remember, with Apache Cassandra you model the database tables on the queries you want to run.
Create queries to ask the following three questions of the data
1. Give me the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history that was heard during sessionId = 338, and itemInSession = 4
2. Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user (first and last name) for userid = 10, sessionid = 182
3. Give me every user name (first and last) in my music app history who listened to the song 'All Hands Against His Own'
